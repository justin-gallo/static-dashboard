# static-dashboard

This is a more advanced "dashboard" layout to practice CSS grid & flexbox. 

### *Things I learned*

* Using grid nested within another grid to create complex layouts. 
* Flexbox used within a grid is also powerful, and a better tool for certain elements. 
* Practice writing more concise, effective commit messages. 
* Use a div with rounded borders on only two corners to create accents on cards. 
* Advanced my understanding of gradients & color schemes.
