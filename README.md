# static-dashboard

This is a more advanced "dashboard" layout to practice CSS grid & flexbox. 

### *Things I learned*

* Using grid nested within another grid to create complex layouts. 
* Flexbox used within a grid is also powerful, and a better tool for certain elements. 
* Practice writing more concise, effective commit messages. 
* Use a div with rounded borders on only two corners to create accents on cards. 
* Advanced my understanding of gradients & color schemes. 
* Working one element at a time is a nearly essential tactic when working with nested grids/flexbox. Trying to do too much at once makes everything too hard to keep track of, and hurts my brain. 
* On the same vein, adding borders to elements within a grid is helpful to see how much space rows/columns are *actually* taking up.
